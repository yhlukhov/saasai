# Stream - skill router + CLI

This skill picks the track from the user's input. Building (web + platform) and docs go to dedicated sub-skills; **CLI tasks - querying data, configuring an app, onboarding, installing skills - are handled here** (see Stream CLI below), since the `getstream` CLI underlies every track.

> **Read first:** [`RULES.md`](RULES.md). Non-negotiable rules apply, including the **Peer skills** procedure. [`peers.yaml`](peers.yaml) (schema: [`peers.schema.json`](peers.schema.json)) is the single source of truth for peer names, Glob paths, install commands, and routing signals.
>
> Install a missing peer on demand per its policy in `peers.yaml` (Glob its path, run its install command - `getstream skills <name>`), then invoke via the `Skill` tool or Read it inline. Don't call `Skill` before the Glob; it surfaces a confusing "Unknown skill" error. Do not stop after naming the track.

---

## By task

**Build or integrate Stream in a platform-specific app** -> peer pack from [`peers.yaml`](peers.yaml) (**check peer signals first**)
- Match user input or cwd against each peer's `signals` (e.g. `swift` / `swiftui` / `.xcodeproj` -> `stream-swift`; `react native` / `expo` / `stream video react native` -> `stream-react-native`; `unreal` / `.uproject` / `umg` -> `stream-unreal`; `unity` / `monobehaviour` / `.unitypackage` -> `stream-unity`)
- All peers install on demand - install if missing, then route, no prompt
- **An SDK/engine signal beats an OS-target signal.** When both appear, the pack that owns the SDK wins: "build an Unreal chat app for iOS" is `stream-unreal` (not `stream-swift`), "a Unity game on Android" is `stream-unity` (not `stream-android`). `ios` / `android` / `xcode` / `gradle` describe the *build target*; `unity` / `unreal` / `.uproject` / `.unitypackage` / `umg` / `flutter` / `react native` describe the *SDK*. Same rule for `flutter` + `ios`.
- **Name the engine for game requests.** `stream-unreal` and `stream-unity` both claim generic game phrasing (`in-game chat`, `game chat`). An explicit engine token decides it; with neither engine named and no `.uproject` / `ProjectSettings/` in the cwd, ask one short question ("Unity or Unreal?") rather than guessing. Note the capability difference that answer implies: Unity has **Chat and Video**, Unreal has **Chat only**.
- **Peer signals take precedence over the web rows below.** A request like "add a video call to my Expo app" or "scaffold a React Native app with Stream Video" matches `stream-react-native`, not the web packs - the platform token wins.

**Build / enhance / audit / migrate a web app with Stream (React / Next.js)** -> use the `stream-react` skill (the default web pack when no other platform signal is present)
- "build me a Chat/Video/Feeds app", "scaffold", "create a new ...", "add Chat to this app", "integrate Video", "drop Feeds into ...", "upgrade/migrate ... to vN" - and **no platform signal** (no `react native`, `expo`, `swift`, `ios`, `android`, etc.)
- React / Next.js tokens (`stream-chat-react`, `@stream-io/video-react-sdk`, `useCreateChatClient`, `MessageList`, ...) with a build/integrate verb also route here
- Covers Track A (scaffold, Steps 0-7), Track E (enhance an existing project), Track F (read-only best-practices audit), Track M (migrate/upgrade an SDK version)

**Build with the framework-agnostic builder** -> use the `stream-builder` skill **only when the user names it explicitly** ("use stream-builder", "/stream-builder")
- `stream-builder` is the generic builder being extended to other app kinds; web React/Next.js defaults to `stream-react` above

**Audit/review an existing Stream Video integration against best practices** (read-only - no scaffolding, no CLI, no build steps)
- Peer signal (`react native` / `expo`) -> `stream-react-native`; web / React / Next.js or no platform signal -> `stream-react` (Track F)
- **Video only.** The dedicated best-practices audit covers Stream **Video**. Chat/Feeds have no dedicated audit checklist yet - `stream-react` handles those requests with a general docs-based review and says so up front.
- Triggers: "audit/review my video integration", "is my video app production-ready?", "what am I missing before launch?"
- Routes here even when the request contains "check" - the audit intent takes precedence over the CLI "check {anything}" route below

**Build or review a Feeds v2 -> v3 sync mapping** -> use the `stream-feeds-migration` skill
- "what mapping do we need?", "set up our v2 to v3 migration", "review our v3sync mapping", "why did the migrated activity lose its text/attachments/comments?"
- Produces the `mapping` config object by sampling the v2 app's own activities and reactions - it does not build or change an app
- Needs the **v2** app's API key and secret in the environment; see the skill's Step 1 and [`RULES.md`](RULES.md) > **Secrets**

**Query Stream data or run a CLI command** -> handled here (see **Stream CLI** below)
- "list calls", "show channels", "any flagged", "find users", a literal `getstream` command, or "install the CLI" / "set up stream"

**Search Stream SDK documentation** -> use the `stream-docs` skill
- "docs", "documentation", explicit SDK token (`Chat React`, `Video iOS`, `Feeds Node`, `Moderation`)
- "how do I ... in <framework>", "how does <hook/component/method> work?", "what does <SDK thing> do?"

## Pick a track

Scan the user's input for the signals below in order. The classifier is deterministic - no probes, no fetches, no CLI checks at this stage.

| Signal in user input | Route |
|---|---|
| **Upgrade / migrate an installed SDK** (build/integrate intent - matched **before** the docs rows): "upgrade/migrate/bump/update `stream-chat-react` to vN", "migrate to the new SDK version", "bump my Stream version" - an upgrade verb (`upgrade`/`migrate`/`bump`/`update`) + a Stream package token, **no peer signal**. Peer signal (`react native` / `expo` / an `@stream-io/*-react-native-*` token) -> `stream-react-native` instead (its own migration flow). | `stream-react` (Track M) |
| **Audit/review an existing integration** (read-only - matched **before** the SDK-token / docs rows below): "audit/review my video integration", "audit my Chat React integration", "review my Video React app", "is my video app production-ready?", "what am I missing before launch?" - audit/review intent **even when an SDK token like `Chat React` / `Video React` is present**. Peer signal (`react native` / `expo`) -> `stream-react-native`; web / React / Next.js or no platform signal -> `stream-react` (Track F - Video has a **dedicated checklist**; Chat/Feeds get a general docs-based review, stated up front). **Also wins over the CLI "check {anything}" row below** whenever the request frames a best-practices / production-readiness review rather than a data query. | matching platform pack (read-only audit) |
| Explicit SDK/framework token: `Chat React`, `Video iOS`, `Feeds Node`, `Moderation`, etc. (with or without version), and **no build/integrate verb and no audit/review intent** (`upgrade`/`migrate`/`bump`/`update` count as build/integrate verbs -> migration row above; "audit/review" -> audit row above) | `stream-docs` |
| Words "docs" or "documentation" (and no build/integrate verb) | `stream-docs` |
| "How do I {X} in {framework}?", "How does {hook/component/method} work?", "What does {SDK thing} do?" - and **no build/integrate verb**. If the request is "how do I add/build/integrate/scaffold {X} in {framework}" and `{framework}` matches a peer signal, the peer row below wins instead. | `stream-docs` |
| Operational verbs + Stream noun: "list calls", "show channels", "any flagged", "find users", "check {anything}", or a literal `getstream` command (`getstream api`, `getstream init`, `getstream login`, ...), or "install the CLI" / "set up stream" | **Stream CLI** - handle here (below) |
| **Build/integration intent + a token matching a peer's `signals` in [`peers.yaml`](peers.yaml)** (e.g. `swift` / `.xcodeproj` -> `stream-swift`; `react native` / `expo` / `stream video react native` / `stream video rn` -> `stream-react-native`; `unreal` / `ue5` / `.uproject` / `umg` -> `stream-unreal`; `unity` / `monobehaviour` / `.unitypackage` / `il2cpp` -> `stream-unity`). **This row takes precedence over the web `stream-react` rows below whenever a peer signal is present, and also wins over the docs how-to rows above whenever the request contains a build/integrate verb (`add`, `build`, `integrate`, `scaffold`, `wire`, `set up`, `create`, `upgrade`, `migrate`, `bump`, `update`) alongside the peer signal.** Note: `react native` / `react-native` (and `@stream-io/*-react-native-*` tokens) are `stream-react-native` signals and win over the web `react` default - including for upgrade/migrate/update requests, which the RN pack handles itself. | matching peer (installed on demand if missing) |
| **Literal mention of `stream-builder` / `/stream-builder`** (the framework-agnostic builder) | `stream-builder` |
| "Build me a ... app", "scaffold", "create a new ..." + Stream product, OR a React/Next.js token (`stream-chat-react`, `@stream-io/video-react-sdk`, `useCreateChatClient`, ...) + build/integrate verb, **and no peer signal present** | `stream-react` (web/Next.js, the default when no platform signal is given) |
| "Add Chat/Video/Feeds to this app", "integrate Stream into", "upgrade/migrate ... to vN" - existing project, **and no peer signal present** | `stream-react` (web/Next.js, the default when no platform signal is given) |
| Operational verb wrapped in how-to phrasing (e.g. "how do I list my calls?" - docs *or* CLI) | **Ask one disambiguator** |

**Onboarding carve-outs.** `stream-docs` only runs `getstream docs` - no `getstream init`, no project inspection. **Read-only / local-only tracks also skip onboarding:** a platform pack's **audit** track (e.g. `stream-react` Track F) and **migrate** track (e.g. `stream-react` Track M) only inspect/edit local files and the live docs - they do **not** provision orgs/apps or call `getstream api`, so they need no CLI onboarding. Only **build/integrate** work (scaffold a new app, add a product to an existing one) runs `getstream init` before doing real work.

**Docs vs platform packs.** A pure how-to or method-lookup question about an iOS/Android/etc. SDK symbol stays in `stream-docs` - don't pull in a platform pack for a documentation answer. Platform packs (e.g. `stream-swift`) are for *building or integrating* - scaffolding projects, wiring packages, generating views.

**React framework scope.** `stream-react` scaffolds (Track A) a **Next.js** app. For enhance / audit / migrate on a **non-Next.js** React project (Vite, CRA, Remix, TanStack Start, etc.) `stream-react` still owns it - the Stream SDK wiring is identical - but the agent must adapt the Next.js-specific bits: the server-side token route lives in the project's own backend (not a Next.js `/api` route), and verification uses the project's build command (`npm run build`), not `next build`. Never assume Next.js APIs on a non-Next project.

**Disambiguator.** If the input fits more than one row (typically operational verb + how-to phrasing), ask one short question and wait. Don't probe before the answer:

> Want me to look up the SDK method (docs) or run it now via CLI?

After the answer, route as if the user had given that signal directly.

**Bare `/stream` with no args.** Render the menu under "Quick navigation" **verbatim**, then wait for input. No shell execution, no probing, no install.

---

## Stream CLI

CLI tasks - querying data, configuring an app, onboarding, installing skills - are handled here; the `getstream` CLI is the substrate every track uses. Run `getstream -h` for the command list and `getstream <command> -h` for usage, and **follow what the CLI prints**. Safety and posture (no guessing, confirm before writing): [`RULES.md`](RULES.md) > CLI safety. If `getstream` isn't installed, ask the user to install it from https://getstream.io and wait - never fetch or run an install script.

| Command | When to reach for it |
|---|---|
| `getstream init` | Onboard a project - authenticate, pick or create an org + app, write credentials. Start here. |
| `getstream api <Endpoint>` | Query data or run a one-off API operation. |
| `getstream env` | Write the app's API key (and secret, for server targets) into the platform's env file. |
| `getstream token <user>` | Mint a token for a user (e.g. demo/dev auth, seeding). |
| `getstream login` | Authenticate (`--guest` for a throwaway account). |
| `getstream skills <name>` | Install a Stream agent skill on demand (e.g. `getstream skills stream-swift`). |

## Sendbird data migration (shared, language-agnostic)

A platform pack's Sendbird migration covers the **code/SDK** swap (e.g. `stream-swift`
`sendbird-migration.md`, `stream-react` `sendbird-migration.md`). Moving the **data** (users, channels, message history, reactions)
is server-side and SDK-independent, so it lives once, here, in
[`sendbird-data-migration.md`](sendbird-data-migration.md) - **any** platform pack hands off
to it. It picks a strategy (hard switch / uni-directional / bi-directional sync), exports from
Sendbird, builds the JSONL import file, validates, and imports via the `getstream` CLI
(`CreateImportURL` -> upload -> `CreateImport` -> `GetImport`). Read it when a code migration
finishes and the user wants their history brought over.

---

## Quick navigation

For a bare `/stream` (and whenever the user wants to pick a skill directly), output the block below **verbatim** - keep the Core / Platform SDKs split, the examples, and the closing line - then wait:

> **Stream** - Chat - Video - Feeds - Moderation. Tell me what you want, or pick a skill directly:
>
> **Core**
> - `/stream-react` - scaffold, enhance, audit, or migrate a React / Next.js web app with Stream (the default for web) - e.g. *"build me a chat app"*
> - `/stream-docs` - look up SDK docs via `getstream docs`, with citations - e.g. *"how does useChannel work?"*
> - `/stream-builder` - the framework-agnostic builder (web defaults to `/stream-react`; pick this only if you name it explicitly)
> - `/stream-feeds-migration` - build the v2 -> v3 Feeds sync mapping from your app's live data - e.g. *"what mapping do we need for our app?"*
>
> **Platform SDKs**
> - `/stream-swift` - Swift - SwiftUI - UIKit - iOS
> - `/stream-android` - Android - Jetpack Compose - Kotlin
> - `/stream-react-native` - React Native - Expo
> - `/stream-flutter` - Flutter - Dart
> - `/stream-unity` - Unity Engine - C# (Chat + Video)
> - `/stream-unreal` - Unreal Engine - C++ - Blueprint (Chat only)
>
> Or just ask - query data or run `getstream` commands directly: *"list my channels"*. New to a skill? Just describe the task and I'll install the right one automatically.

The closing line is load-bearing: typing an uninstalled slash command errors with "Unknown skill" *before* this router runs, so natural-language description is the only dead-end-proof path - it routes here and the missing peer is installed per [`peers.yaml`](peers.yaml). Keep this menu in sync with `peers.yaml`: every peer there appears here under Core or Platform SDKs, and new platforms get a bullet under Platform SDKs when their entry is added.

## Hand-off

See preamble: install if missing, invoke via `Skill` tool, don't stop. Cross-cutting rules in [`RULES.md`](RULES.md) apply to every sub-skill, including **Cross-track follow-ups** (offer, don't auto-execute, the natural next action across track boundaries).
